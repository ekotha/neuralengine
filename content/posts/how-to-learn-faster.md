I'm currently working on this topic. 

Take notes. You will retain more if you take notes. 
These notes should be handwritten. You can write them by hand on a tablet using something like Concepts or Apple Notes (Freeform) to keep them accessible while retaining the strengths. 

Do not highlight, or reread the text or notes. That is a waste of time. <br>
Do this instead: <br>
- Create a mind map of the material you learned.
- Teach the material to an imaginary student
- Make practice test questions (NOT flashcards but actual test questions)

Whenever you do the above, you want to try recalling everything 100% from your memory without looking at any notes. This is supposed to feel challenging because it is! The struggle means your mind is making those connections when you review your accuracy later.
