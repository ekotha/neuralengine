[keep the lights on] is the idea that sufficiency is sometimes needed before acting on ambition. <br>
You have to do what you have to do to make it to the next step, day, phase, etc. 

Stay the course, reorient, and reallocate your resources as needed. The results from action will be the best informants of future plans more than future plans can be of future actions.
