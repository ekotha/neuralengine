This is an all-encompassing note on suits. 

 “suit” is derived from the French term suivre, which means “to follow.” (jacket follows the pants or pants follow the jacket)

 Beau Brummell – can't talk about suits without Brummel. He was one of the earliest to wear a suit back in the early 1800s, rejecting the frills of powdered wigs, and frock coats often seen in the French Court, and opting for simple trousers, simple jackets, neckties and boots.   

## Some Style Rules

Navy suits can be worn with black and brown belt and shoes. Black suits don't have the same versatility.
Shirt → Big cuffs, high collar, good quality pearl buttons. 

Neck Size → Should be able to fit one finger between collar and neck when shirt is fully buttoned.
