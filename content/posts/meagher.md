## Olympic Swimmer

Mary T Meagher's legacy is in her work as a swimmer, commentator and mentor. Her dominance in butterfly events have had coaches and other swimmers studying her technique in order to emulate her. 
Competed in the 1984 and 1988 Summer Olympics -> Winning 3 gold medals and 1 silver medal. She set records in 100 and 200 meter butterfly events (was the record for 2 decades!)

She trained for several hours a day, six days a week, under the guidance of her coach, Paul Bergen.

## Additional
I've also wondered how Katie Ledecky has been so dominant in the sport. Will be good to check out her technique.
