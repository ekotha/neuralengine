## Hi! This is my public knowledge garden blog.

It has a bunch of my notes and mini blog posts. As time goes on it may include audio, video, images, math, code, diagrams etc.
I chose Netflify for deployment and went with a custom Hugo theme that enabled quick text search and tagging right out of the box.

Thanks for stopping by. :)
